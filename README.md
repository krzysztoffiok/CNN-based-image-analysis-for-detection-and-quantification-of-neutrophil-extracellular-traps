The dataset is divided into 4 .zip files containing:
- train_val_split_used_for_training.zip - images and annotations (in mscoco json format) used during training of the model described in paper;
- large_validation_set.zip - images and annotations (in pascalvoc xml format and mscoco json format) used for validation of the model after training procedure was completed;
- for_coco_evaluation.zip - small set of images for evaluation; and
- in the "release" section "original_uncompressed_images_with_pascalvoc_annotations.zip" containing uncompressed images used for training of the model can be found.

Example detections carried out by the model described in paper:
